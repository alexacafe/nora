im finding the cure for bordum
kids will like it

##inspiration
the inspiration was that I saw other websites that had all these games, but they were on other websites. I wanted a website that showed you games from all different kinds of websites. My website includes games from silver games, cool math games, io, and more. It is the cure to boredom.

##design
I like purple, fuscia, and aquamarine so I used all of those colors. I wanted aquamarine to be the border, and fuscia to be the after background and purple to be the before background. Hooray! I used CSS to make this happen.

##code
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website. On the opening page, I wanted to ask "How are you today?" and have "good" and "bad" as the answer options. i used jQuery it is a javaScrpt library. it has a conditional statement. if you click good it says yes if you click bad then it says Aw :(. then it will ask you if you want to play a game. if you click yes it will say click the puppy to get started.if you say no it will say OK bye. 

after you click the puppy to get sarted it brings you to the games and then you click one and it brings you to the game. i used an aray for all of the game links and all of the game pictures. i used a for loop to go through the arays and make each game apear on the screen. i also coded a random button. when you click on it it calls a function that i wrote in javaScript. the function gets a random game from thr aray if you cannot choose adn opens it in a new window.
